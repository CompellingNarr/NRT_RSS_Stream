1. Readme.md: running from command line...
```
java -cp ./target/cn_rss_poller-0.0.20160215.1900-SNAPSHOT.jar com.cn.nrt_feed.CnRssPoller
```
doesn't work

2. `CnRssPoller.java` - finish HttpClient and HttpGet to get data from RSS site

3. Add one thread per poll to allow multiple RSS sites concurrently

4. `CNSimpleDomXmlParse` - finish
